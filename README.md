#### Single Object Tracking with a Bayesian Recursive Filter
Given detected 2D locations of a vehicle over multiple frames in the video, you need to implement an alpha-beta filter or a Kalman filter to generate a smooth 2D track of the vehicle based on these 2D observations.

#### Multi-Object Tracking and Data Association
Given the bounding boxes of multiple objects detected in the video, you need to track them by assigning a unique ID to each object over the video as long as they are detected.
